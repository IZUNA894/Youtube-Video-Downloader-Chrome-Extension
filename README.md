# Youtube-Video-Downloader(Chrome-Extension)
Its a chrome extension for downloading Youtube videos in desired video and audio formats.

Its still under work. There are somethings which i need to resolve first.

1: if video starts playing with a advertisement first in start...then this extension will not work.you have to refresh the page.

2: youtube recently changes the way of storing the videos in its database.it now stored video and audio seprately...so i have to download both files seprately and do some video editing to give user a single ,one file to download,this again need some video editing library like video.js or ffmpeg.js

3:something have to do about chrome api for using chrome.runtime method properly...

I am currently working on it ....
### Technology Use
